        "\n",
        "Welcome to Lab 1 of our course on Natural Language Processing! In this lab you will learn to implement different text-preprocessing techniques commonly used for NLP tasks as well as implement a standard text-classification algorithm for categorizing different news articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "We assume that you are familiar with `python` programming language, and its libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`. We will also make use of other libraries like `nltk` and `pytorch` in the assignment. Familiarity with these libraries is not assumed so we will provide short tutorials on their usage within the assignment.\n",

        "Expected learning outcomes from this Lab include:\n",
        "- Understand and implement text pre-processing techniques for NLP tasks\n",
        "- Gain understanding of count / frequency based bag of word models for performing text classification\n",
        "- Learn how to use Pytorch to define and train models for text classification"

        "It can be often benificial to group together different inflections of a word into a single term. For eg. *organizes* and *organizing* are the morphological inflections of the word *organize*, and replacing the instances of *organizes* and *organizing* with *organize* in our text data can help us reduce the number of unique words in our vocabulary. Stemming is one such approach to reduce the inflectional forms into a common base form.\n",
        "\n",
        "One common way of performing steming over the words are the *Suffix Removal* algorithms, which involves removing certain suffixes from the word based on a pre-defined set of rules like:\n",
        "- If the word ends with 's' remove 's' (denoted as S-> ϵ.eg. plays -> play)\n",
        "- If the word ends with 'es' remove 'es' (denoted as ES-> ϵ. eg. mangoes -> mango).\n",
        "- If the word ends with 'ing' remove 'ing'. (denoted as ING -> ϵ. eg. enjoying  -> enjoying)\n",

It is limited to the 4 rules so misses some obvious cases like reducing *connection* to *connect* or sometimes can over stem the word like for the word *fly* above is stemmed to `f` which loses the meaning of the original word. The more sophisticated algorithms use a bunch of rules and heuristics to avoid such situations. One of the most commonly used stemming algorithm is `Porter Stemmer`, which uses a 5 step procedure involving different suffix removal as well as modification rules to perform stemming.

These features can be of different types depending upon the downstream application, like for building a classifier to predict whether to give credit to a customer we might consider features like their age, income, employement status etc. In the same way to build a classifier for textual data, we need a way to describe each text example in terms of numeric features which can then be fed to the classification algorithm of our choice.\n",

        "Here, Θ denotes the model parameters, J is the loss function and α is what we call learning rate which is used to specify the strength of the step that we wish to take. A smaller learning rate ensures we do not move away from the minima, but it makes the learning slower, while with a larger learning rate we move quickly towards the minima but are susceptible to overshooting it. Variants of SGD like SGD + Momentum, RMSProp, Adam etc., tries to improve it's noisy nature (which arises due to the fact we work on batches, instead of the entire dataset at a time), by introducing minor modifications to the update equation to prevent the optimizer taking a step in an overly wrong direction, and some also introduce heuristics to decay the step size as we reach closer to the minima. Adam is one of the most used optimizers in Deep Learning applications and often works reasonably well in practical applications. We will use the same for our experiments.
